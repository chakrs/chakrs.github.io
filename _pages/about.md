I am a mission-driven technology leader passionate about leveraging data, AI, and product innovation to create meaningful business and social impact—especially through advancing data-informed decision-making. With over 15 years of progressive leadership in technology and product development, I specialize in guiding cross-functional teams to build scalable, data-driven platforms that empower organizations to realize their goals.

My core strengths lie in data architecture, analytics, and responsible data governance, coupled with a proven ability to lead product teams in delivering innovative and impactful solutions. I thrive in strategic advisory roles, coaching teams to reach their full potential while driving organizational transformation through applied AI, modern UX frameworks, and agile methodologies.

I bring extensive leadership experience, with a demonstrated ability to deliver value through team empowerment and innovation. My technical proficiency spans cloud computing, software development, data platforms, and DevOps/agile transformation—building highly reliable cloud-native solutions using best-in-class technologies and methodologies.

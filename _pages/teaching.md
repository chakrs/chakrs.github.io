Adjunct Professor â€“ University of Texas at Arlington


I currently serve as an adjunct professor at the University of Texas at Arlington, where I teach graduate-level courses in Data Warehouse & Business Intelligence and Data Engineering. My teaching focuses on bridging foundational data management principles with modern data engineering technologies, preparing students for real-world roles in analytics, business intelligence, and data platform development.

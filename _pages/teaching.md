I currently teach a graduate-level course at the University of Texas, Arlington. The course name is Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence.

In this course, students learn the full lifecycle of designing and developing data warehouse systems. We focus on building a solid understanding of OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) models and how they differ from OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) models. The curriculum is designed to provide students with both theoretical insights and practical experience.

The course also delves into modern advancements in data management and engineering, such as Delta Lakes, Databricks File System (DBFS), Delta Live Tables, Data Orchestration, and Workflow Management. Hands-on demonstrations and practical assignments help students apply these technologies in real-world scenarios, ensuring they are well-prepared for careers in data engineering and business intelligence.
